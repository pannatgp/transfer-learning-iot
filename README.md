# Thesis Project: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Framework for IoT Networks

## Overview
This project explores the application of deep learning and transfer learning techniques for anomaly detection in IoT network traffic. With the increasing proliferation of IoT devices, new security vulnerabilities have emerged, necessitating robust monitoring mechanisms for detecting malicious activities such as DDoS attacks, malware distribution, and unauthorized entries.

## Objective
The objective of this thesis is to develop an adaptive framework that leverages deep learning and transfer learning to enhance security in IoT networks. This framework aims to efficiently and effectively identify abnormal traffic patterns and potential threats in real-time, thus improving the overall security posture of IoT environments.

## Models Used
1. **Pre-trained Models**:
   - **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**: Initially trained on the UNSW-NB15 dataset and retrained on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset for enhanced adaptability.


## Getting Started
To replicate or further develop the adaptive anomaly detection framework, follow the setup and execution instructions below.
